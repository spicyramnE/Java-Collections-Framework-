# Java Collections Framework Practice Set

## Why This Repository Exists

I was preparing for interviews and realized something frustrating - there are plenty of tutorials explaining Java Collections, but very few places to actually *practice* using them.
If you are here, you probably checked it all (gfg,w3s,tp) & weren't satisfied yourself! So here is my take on Collections' basics.

## What You'll Find Here

This isn't just another tutorial repository. It's a hands-on practice ground where you can:
- Solve basic-to-advance problems using different Collection types
- Compare your solutions with provided answers
- Understand *when* and *why* to use specific collections

## A Little Confession

I'm also learning Git while building this, so if you see some messy commits or weird branching... that's me figuring things out! ðŸ˜… Feel free to suggest improvements - I'm here to learn too.
